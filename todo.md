# Camera Control in Godot for Different Game States

You're making an Undertale-like game with different camera requirements for overworld exploration and combat modes. This is a common pattern in Godot games, and I'll explain how to implement this effectively.

## Understanding the Current Setup

From your code, I can see:

1. You have a `GameController` singleton that handles scene loading
2. You have both a global `Player` class for the overworld and a separate `CombatPlayer` for combat scenes
3. The `Overworld` scene already references a camera (line 47 in Overworld.cs)

## Implementation Approach

You'll want to handle camera control differently between the overworld (following the player) and combat (static view of the arena). Here's how to approach it:

### 1. Overworld Camera (Player Following)

You already have a camera setup in your overworld mode:

```csharp
_camera = _player.GetNode<Camera2D>("Camera2D");
```

This indicates your camera is a child of the player, which is the simplest way to make a camera follow a character. This works well for your overworld exploration.

### 2. Combat Camera (Static)

For combat scenes, you should:

1. Add a camera directly to your combat scene rather than as a child of the player
2. Configure it with different properties for the combat view

## Implementation

### Step 1: Update Your Combat Scene

When creating your combat scene, add a Camera2D that's not attached to the player:

```csharp
public partial class CombatArena : Node2D
{
    private Camera2D _combatCamera;
    
    public override void _Ready()
    {
        // Create or get the combat camera
        _combatCamera = GetNode<Camera2D>("CombatCamera");
        
        // Make sure this camera is active
        _combatCamera.MakeCurrent();
        
        // Configure camera settings for combat
        _combatCamera.Zoom = new Vector2(1.0f, 1.0f); // Adjust zoom as needed
        _combatCamera.Position = new Vector2(0, 0);   // Center of the arena
    }
}
```

### Step 2: Handle Camera Transitions in GameController

Update your `GameController` to manage camera state when switching between scene types:

```csharp
public void LoadCombatScene(string mapPath)
{
    try
    {
        // Disable the player's camera if it exists
        var player = Player.Instance;
        if (player != null)
        {
            var playerCamera = player.GetNode<Camera2D>("Camera2D");
            if (playerCamera != null)
            {
                playerCamera.Current = false;
            }
        }
        
        // Rest of your existing code...
        if (_currentMap != null)
        {
            _currentMap.QueueFree();
            _currentMap = null;
        }

        var mapScene = ResourceLoader.Load<PackedScene>(mapPath);
        if (mapScene == null)
        {
            GD.PrintErr($"Failed to load map scene: {mapPath}");
            return;
        }

        _currentMap = mapScene.Instantiate();
        AddChild(_currentMap);

        GD.Print($"Map loaded: {mapPath}");
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        GD.PrintErr($"Error loading Combat scene: {e.Message}");
    }
}

public void LoadOverworldScene(string scenePath)
{
    try
    {
        // Rest of your existing code...
        if (_currentMap != null)
        {
            _currentMap.QueueFree();
            _currentMap = null;
        }

        var mapScene = ResourceLoader.Load<PackedScene>(scenePath);
        if (mapScene == null)
        {
            GD.PrintErr($"Failed to load Overworld scene: {scenePath}");
            return;
        }

        _currentMap = mapScene.Instantiate();
        AddChild(_currentMap);

        GD.Print($"Overworld Scene loaded: {_currentMap.Name}");

        // If we have a player reference, place them at the stored position
        var player = Player.Instance;
        if (player != null)
        {
            player.SetInitialPosition(_playerPosition);
            
            // Re-enable the player's camera
            var playerCamera = player.GetNode<Camera2D>("Camera2D");
            if (playerCamera != null)
            {
                playerCamera.MakeCurrent();
            }
        }
    }
    catch (Exception e)
    {
        GD.PrintErr($"Error loading Overworld scene: {e.Message}");
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Add Camera Properties for Combat Mode

For combat scenes, you might want specific camera properties. Add a method to your `GameController` to set these up:

```csharp
public void ConfigureCombatCamera(Camera2D camera)
{
    // Set up standard combat camera settings
    camera.Zoom = new Vector2(1.0f, 1.0f);  // Adjust to your needs
    camera.DragHorizontalEnabled = false;   // No need for drag in combat
    camera.DragVerticalEnabled = false;
    camera.PositionSmoothingEnabled = false; // Instant positioning
    
    // You could store these settings in variables if you want to allow customization
}
```

## Advanced Camera Control

If you need more advanced camera behavior:

### Overworld Camera Improvements

1. **Smoothing**: For the player follow camera, you might want to add smoothing:
   ```csharp
   _camera.PositionSmoothingEnabled = true;
   _camera.PositionSmoothingSpeed = 4.0f;
   ```

2. **Screen Limits**: You can constrain the camera to level boundaries:
   ```csharp
   _camera.LimitLeft = 0;
   _camera.LimitTop = 0;
   _camera.LimitRight = 1920; // Your level width
   _camera.LimitBottom = 1080; // Your level height
   ```

### Combat Camera Enhancements

1. **Screen Shake**: For dramatic moments during combat:
   ```csharp
   public void ShakeCombatCamera(float intensity, float duration)
   {
       var camera = GetCombatCamera();
       if (camera != null)
       {
           // Implement screen shake logic
           // You could use the built-in Shake() method or a custom implementation
       }
   }
   ```

2. **Camera Transitions**: Smooth transitions between camera states:
   ```csharp
   private Tween _cameraTween;
   
   public void TransitionToPosition(Camera2D camera, Vector2 newPosition, float duration)
   {
       if (_cameraTween != null)
       {
           _cameraTween.Kill();
       }
       
       _cameraTween = CreateTween();
       _cameraTween.TweenProperty(camera, "position", newPosition, duration);
       _cameraTween.Play();
   }
